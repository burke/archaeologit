Web Base visualizer for projects stored in git, it allows you to browser each file over time via slider.

My project for this class will be to build a better way to search for "stuff".

It works with linux core


The plan is to allow searching by commit id's comit ranges, date ranges, files, authors.

So the work for this class will be using something like an expert system to interpret what the user is actually asking for, with an amazon style single search box.
